# DIMYContactTracingProtocol
My implementation of the DIMY contact tracing protocol, as described in the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05873v1.pdf
Please refer to the Midterm DIMY.mp4 video and Midterm report for an explanation of the features used in the protocol and the DIMY Demo.mp4 video and final report for an explanation on how the program works. 
This assignment was proposed to be completed by 3 people, however enough group members couldn't be found so it was decided to be completed individually. As a result, not enough time was remaining to complete the extension tasks:
  1. Using a TCP connection for connecting to the backend API
  2. Showing the QBF-CBF matching process in a terminal
